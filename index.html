                        What is Freelancing & What Does it Mean to Freelance?
                    </h5>
                    <!-- Paragraph will be the Par class -->
                    <p class="par">
                        You may be wondering, “so what is freelancing?” Freelancing means to work as an independent company rather than be employed by someone else. Freelancers are self-employed and often referred to as independent contractors. Freelancers are hired by other
                        companies on a part time or short-term basis, but they do not receive the same compensation as full-time employees or have the same level of commitment to any particular company

                    <h5 class="sechead">How does freelancing work?</h5>
                    <p class="par">
                        Freelancers accept payment in return for providing some sort of service. That agreement is generally part-time or short term. For example, if I hired a photographer to take new headshots for me, I could pay a freelancer for that session and that would
                        be the end of it. Sometimes people pay freelancers to work a set number of hours per week or per month. That arrangement is often referred to as a “retainer.” A retainer refers to when you retain the services or right to someone’s
                        time. A lot of legal professional’s work on retainer. Every month, they bill a set amount of time to the client, regardless of whether that full time is used or not. It’s really one of the simplest and most pure forms of entrepreneurship:
                        the freelancer provides a specific service or outcome, and the buyer pays them a fee directly

                            3. Control over your workload – You can be selective about which tasks to take on, so if a job will take too long, or doesn't pay well enough, there's no harm in rejecting it.

                            1. Keeping up with tax – Filling out self-assessment tax returns can be confusing, but our guide can help.

                        <li>
                            5. Working on your own – As most of your work will be done on your tod at home, it can get lonely. Look for freelancing groups on sites like Facebook or Meet Up to find other people to chill with while you work.
